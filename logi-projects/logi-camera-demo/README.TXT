LOGI Image Processing Project *************************************************************************
* DOCUMENTATION: http://valentfx.com/wiki/index.php?title=LOGI_-_Image_Processing_-_Project
* DESCRIPTION  **************
The LOGI image processing demo App is intended to be a plug and play demo of machine vision using the LOGI boarrds.  Machine vision applications are can be very data processing intensive, which makes them a perfect candiate for an FPGA.  The demo capture image data, image processes and streams the data using mpjeg streamer to a networked remote PC.  The user can view the video stream by simply opening a web browser and entering the ip address of the connected bone/pi followed by port :8080.  
press PB1 (RPi) or use onboard DIP SW (BBB) to toggle through the different image processing modes.  
* INSTRUCTIONS *************
Generate Programming File using Xilinx ISE open: File | New Project | logi-edu-demo/hw/logipi/ise/logipi-hw.xise
* TROUBLESHOOTING **********

* SUGGESTIONS **************
Open up the individual project folders such as logi-pi-edu-pong to build each project.
