EDU Demo Project *************************************************************************
* DOCUMENTATION: http://valentfx.com/wiki/index.php?title=LOGI_-_EDU_Demo_-_Project
* DESCRIPTION  **************
The LOGI EDU package is an expansion board board for the LOGI Pi FPGA board.  The LOGI EDU serves as an educational pathway to allow FPGA beginners to easily learn and implement basics of FPGAs and HDL design. The educational path walks beginners through the basic steps of FPGA design by using examples from the book “FPGA Prototyping By Verilog Examples” or “FPGA Prototyping By VHDL Examples”. The examples can be run by using the add-on EDU expansion module that supports the book examples and applications. Using these examples allows the user to quickly get up to speed with the basics of FPGA design and allows the user to migrate to working on and designing greater complexity FPGA applications.
* INSTRUCTIONS *************
Generate Programming File using Xilinx ISE open: File | New Project | logi-edu-demo/hw/logipi/ise/logipi-hw.xise
* TROUBLESHOOTING **********

* SUGGESTIONS **************
Open up the individual project folders such as logi-pi-edu-pong to build each project.

Recreate logi-pi-vga using logi-projects/logi-edu/logi-edu-demo/hw/logipi/hdl/vga
let a button and the switches change whether each of Red Green and Blue are grey or coloured
hint: see PongChu chapter 12.
