Virtual Component Project *************************************************************************
* DOCUMENTATION: http://valentfx.com/wiki/index.php?title=LOGI_-_Virtual_Components_-_Project
* DESCRIPTION  **************
Using Virtual components is a great way of implementing hardware in the loop at the hobbyist/education level. Using Virtual components allows the user to maximize their use of the LOGi Development boards by being able to easily add components to a project that may not be needed as primary functionality on the development board.  There is no need to have an FPGA board with multiple LEDs, Switches, Buttons, 7 seg.  You can use virtual components to add components you need to use.  You can mix and match pre-designed virtual component modules any configuration needed for the project with no cost, no hardware and no chance of burning anything up.
* INSTRUCTIONS *************
Generate Programming File using Xilinx ISE open: File | New Project | logi-virtual-components/hw/logipi/ise/logipi_virtual_component.xise
startx
python2 virtual_component.py
